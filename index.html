	<h1><i><u>Welcome To Penang</u></i></h1>
	<p>
		<b>Penang</b> is a Malaysian state located on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia, by the Malacca Strait. It
		has
		two parts: Penang Island, where the capital city, <i>George Town</i>, is located, and Seberang Perai (formerly <i>Province
			Wellesley</i>) on the Malay Peninsula. The second smallest Malaysian state by land mass, Penang is bordered by Kedah
		to
		the north and the east, and Perak to the south.
	</p>

	<p>
		Penang's modern history began in 1786, upon the establishment of George Town by Francis Light. Penang formed part of
		the Straits Settlements in 1826, which became a British crown colony in 1867. Direct British rule was only briefly
		interrupted during World War II, when Japan occupied Penang; the British retook Penang in 1945. Penang was later
		merged with the Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia), which gained independence from the British in 1957. Following
		the decline of its entrepôt trade towards the 1970s, Penang's economy was reoriented towards hi-tech manufacturing.

	<h2>Most Interesting Place - Monkey Beach</h2>

	<p>
		<b>Monkey Beach</b> is situated in the Penang National Park in the North-western Coast of the Island. It is one of
		the few
		pristine beaches left on the Island because it is not as exposed to the pollution found along the West Coast of the
		Island.
	</p>
	<p>
		As its name suggests, the beach is inhabited by monkeys of the crab-eating macaque species. A variety of fauna and
		flora can be found within the park including green turtles, flying squirrels, flying lemurs and over 150 species of
		birds. On the beach itself the white-bellied sea eagle can often be spotted.
	</p>
	<p>
		The beach can be reached either by a one and a half-hour hike along the coast or by a short boat ride from the park
		entrance. The calm bay of Monkey Beach is considered safe for swimming, unlike many beaches on the island that are
		infested with jellyfish. Although it is relatively isolated, visitors to the beach are not uncommon and numbers
		increase especially during the summer tourist season. A further half an hour uphill hike from the beach will take
		visitors to the scenic lighthouse.
	</p>

	<h2>Most Memorable Place - Penang Heritage Area</h2>
	<img src="3.jpg" alt="Heritage area Penang">
	<p>
		A fascinating fusion of eastern and western influences, Penang is Malaysia’s most tourist-visited destination. The
		island manages to embrace modernity while retaining its colonial traditions; due to its well-preserved heritage
		buildings Penang’s capital, Georgetown, has been accorded a listing as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although Georgetown’s landscape is dominated by Chinese storefronts – most in need of a good paint job – there are
		also swanky shopping complexes, refurbished Chinese manors, rowdy pubs and artsy boutiques, cafés and studios. The
		city is a mainstay on the Malaysian tourist scene yet it is also a popular expat enclave; besides that, the food
		here– a hotchpotch of Indian curry and Chinese noodles – is for many the best in Malaysia.
	</p>

	<h2>Food that I Enjoyed the Most</h2>
	<img src="4.jpg" alt="Penang laksa">
	<p>
		Sweet, sour and spicy – those are the three magic words best described for fulfiling a satisfying bowl of <b>Penang
			asam
			laksa</b>. With a smorgasbord of slurpy white rice noodles, shredded fish (typically mackerel), sliced pineapples,
		cucumber, onions, red chillis, lettuce, mint leaves steeped within the tamarind-flavoured soup base, what’s not to
		like about this all-time Malaysian favourite?
	</p>

	<h2>My Thought</h2>
	<p>
		Penang is truely a fascinating place to live in. They have old heritage in the town together with modern building
		such as KOMTAR. They have variety of foods. They have hills and beaches. They have warm-hearted people.
	</p>
	<p>
		This trip is fruitful for me, I learned a lot, understand more culture from different background. I hope I can bring
		my family here in Penang, one day in the future!
